## About Playground Livewire

This is just a personal project to play around with Laravel 8 and it's brand new Jetstream scaffolded with Livewire.

Some of the things I'm playing with here:

- Added a new picture to Profile (to see how that's done with Jetstream)
- Added Facebook Authentication (OAuth) with Laravel Socialite



## Contributing

It doesn't make much sense to contribute to this project, as it's just a personal playground to try things on Laravel 8 + Jetstream/Livewire.
